    <p>UNRWA Director Matthias Schmale said Israel has not allowed humanitarian corridors during the hostilities.
        <br>

        “In 2014 we had humanitarian corridors where we could move between installations and bring material,” he told Al
        Jazeera.<br>

        “They are also striking very close to our installation, so the understanding we had in the past such as keeping
        some distance in our installation is not being respected sufficiently,” he said from Gaza.<br><br>

        Asked about reports suggesting that Israel warned the UN agency that it planned to bomb two UN-run schools,
        Schmale said he had not received any direct warnings so far.<br>

        “We have more than 41,000 people in 50 schools, so it would be of great concern if any of these installations
        were directly hit,” he added.
