    <p style="color: white;">Four and a half decades after launch and over 14 billion miles from Earth, Voyager
        1 still makes new discoveries. The spacecraft has picked up the signature of interstellar space
        itself, a faint plasma "hum" scientists compared to gentle rain.<br><br>

        Plasma has been part of Voyager 1's mission from its launch — the spacecraft discovered lightning
        strikes in Jupiter's atmosphere and studied how the solar wind tapered off in the outer solar
        system.<br><br>

        And since 2012, scientists have turned the spacecraft's instruments upon a completely unexplored
        part of distant space. That's when Voyager 1 crossed the heliopause, where the solar wind — the
        constant stream of charged particles that flows off the sun — is no longer strong enough to hold
        back the interstellar medium that surrounds our little neighborhood. Since 2012, as Voyager 1 has
        drifted ever farther from the sun, the spacecraft has measured the plasma around it.<br><br>

        This part of the interstellar medium is, mostly, quiet. "It's very faint and monotone, because it is in a narrow
        frequency bandwidth," Stella Koch Ocker, a doctoral student at Cornell University who led the new research, said
        in a statement. "We're detecting the faint, persistent hum of interstellar gas."<br><br>
